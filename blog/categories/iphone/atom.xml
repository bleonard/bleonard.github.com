    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my recent project, <a href="http://www.bleonard.com/blog/2014/04/03/cakewalk/">Cakewalk</a>, we give the user a fairly complete experience without having to sign up. This seems like the nice thing to do but it's also in Apple's guidelines for app approval. At some point, though, we need to create an account for them. In our case, it's when they want to add an idea to their favorites or save their filter preferences. A "gate" such as this is something I've done on the web many times but it's the first time I've done it an iPhone app. I'll describe how I solved it using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/bxGettingStarted.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007502-CH7-SW1">blocks</a>.</p>

<h2>Web</h2>

<p>On the web, I would usually send them to a URL. If that URL requires a logged in user, then it would redirect to the login/signup URL with a query param. For example, if the page was <code>http://www.example.com/favorite</code>, it would redirect to something like <code>http://www.example.com/login?after_auth=%2Ffavorite</code>. The login/signup form would add this as a hidden parameter that it POSTs. If the action is successful, it will use this url instead of the default one to send the user to next place. In Rails, it would look something like this:</p>

<p>```ruby
def login
  user = User.find_by_email(params[:email])
  if user.authenticate(params[:password])</p>

<pre><code># right!
log_in!(user)
redirect_to params[:after_auth] || dashboard_path
</code></pre>

<p>  else</p>

<pre><code># not right!
render :form
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>If the site allows the users to switch back and forth between login and signup pages or allows Facebook, Twitter or some other OAuth, it can be easy to lose this parameter. I've seen sites put the value in a cookie for this reason. It can simplify it, but is more likely to have unintended site effects.</p>

<h2>Blocks</h2>

<p>Most of the complexity of the web version is because of the stateless nature of the medium. The query parameter or cookie is an attempt to add that state globally. This is not particularly an issue in an iPhone app. The global state is fairly well known in the view controllers and there is shared memory. The interesting thing that I realized is that it's not just data that we can store, but also <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/bxGettingStarted.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007502-CH7-SW1">blocks</a>.</p>

<p>An Objective C block is an inline declaration of a function. It is similar to features available in Ruby and Javascript. Here we use one to change how a sort is done:</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>```objectivec
NSComparator finderSortBlock = ^(id string1, id string2) {</p>

<pre><code>NSRange string1Range = NSMakeRange(0, [string1 length]);
return [string1 compare:string2 options:comparisonOptions range:string1Range locale:currentLocale];
</code></pre>

<p>};</p>

<p>NSArray *finderSortArray = [stringsArray sortedArrayUsingComparator:finderSortBlock];
```</p>

<p>I find it a little hard to read when using them like this, so I typedef'd them as needed:</p>

<p><code>objectivec
// blocks.h
typedef void (^MyVoidBlock)();
typedef void (^MyVoidBlockWithBool)(BOOL);
typedef void (^MyVoidBlockWithString)(NSString *);
typedef void (^MyVoidBlockWithDictionary)(NSDictionary *);
typedef BOOL (^MyBoolBlockWithString)(NSString *);
</code></p>

<p>This allows us to use them throughout the app to provide more semantics to the block in use. For example, in a method declaration:</p>

<p>```objectivec
// MyAppDelegate.h</p>

<h1>import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h></h1>

<p>@interface MyAppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate>
- (void) authenticateWithSuccess:(MyVoidBlock)success;
@end
```</p>

<h2>Use in context</h2>

<p>So most of the time, it does not matter if the user is logged in or not, but then the time comes they hit the "favorite" button and we need to make sure.</p>

<p>```objectivec
// MyIdeaViewController.m
-(void) favoriteButtonPressed: {</p>

<pre><code>MyAppDelegate * delegate = (MyAppDelegate*) [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
[delegate authenticateWithSuccess:^{
    [[CurrentUser shared] setIdeaAsFavorite: self.idea];
}];
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This was the cleanest of several alternatives that I came up with. It just occurred to me, though, that I also could have made a block that passed a user instead of nothing for even better encapsulation.</p>

<p>```objectivec
// blocks.h
typedef void (<sup>MyVoidBlockWithUser)(CurrentUser</sup> *);</p>

<p>// MyAppDelegate.h
- (void) authenticateWithSuccess:(MyVoidBlockWithUser)success;</p>

<p>// MyIdeaViewController.m
-(void) favoriteButtonPressed: {</p>

<pre><code>MyAppDelegate * delegate = (MyAppDelegate*) [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
[delegate authenticateWithSuccess:^(CurrentUser* user) {
    [user setIdeaAsFavorite: self.idea];
}];
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>I did the earlier version because the app already had that shared user concept. Either way, this technique encapsulates all the logic for getting the user authenticated and lets the feature focus on what happens if it is successful (or already logged in).</p>

<h2>Callbacks</h2>

<p>The system works because the block is passed along much like the web parameter.</p>

<p>```objectivec
// MyAppDelegate.m
- (void) authenticateWithSuccess:(MyVoidBlock)success {</p>

<pre><code>if ([CurrentUser isLoggedIn]) {
    // return immediately if the user is already logged in
    success();
}
else {
    // otherwise, launch view that allows login or signup, passing block along
    MyAuthController * auth = [[MyAuthController alloc] initWithSuccess:success];
    auth.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleCoverVertical;
    [self.rootViewController presentViewController:auth animated:YES completion:nil];
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This slides up the authentication controller and most importantly passes along the success callback. Then, if the user does login or signup, the auth controller closes itself, logs the user in, and calls the <code>success</code> block.</p>

<p>```objectivec
// MyAuthController.m
-(void) didSubmitLogin {</p>

<pre><code>[CurrentUser loginWithEmail:self.emailField.text password:self.passwordField.text success:^{
    [self closeAuthentication:YES];
} failure:^(NSError *error) {
    [self showError:error];
}];
</code></pre>

<p>}
-(void) didTapCancelButton {</p>

<pre><code>[self closeAuthentication:NO];
</code></pre>

<p>}
- (void) closeAuthentication:(BOOL)authenticated {</p>

<pre><code>[self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{
    if (authenticated) {
        self.successBlock();
    }
}];
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>If they do hit the cancel, button, it will slide down and everything will be back where it started. However, if they do login, what I think is really cool about this is that it slides down and the originally invoked code is back in the same position as if the user would have been authenticated in the first place.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I hadn't used blocks much in Objective C before, so this ability was a new concept to me. The power of it lies in the simplicity of the <code>favoriteButtonPressed</code> code even in the face of handling several varying circumstances. I'm sure there are other cases like this so it's nice to have a new tool in the toolbelt.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's nice to be useful. I was glad to be able to help out my wife and her partner make a new iPhone app called <a href="http://www.cakewalkapp.com">Cakewalk</a>.</p>

<p>I really like the counter-culture situation of it. Technology has become a way to distract the kids or something you can hand them when you are out of other things to do. <a href="http://www.personify.us">Krista</a> and <a href="http://www.textunvexed.com">Marijane</a> had the idea to use technology to go the other way by giving parents an app that was for them, not the kids. And the goal of the app is to stop using the app and start real playtime with the kids.</p>

<p>Put simply, Cakewalk comes in handy when the kids really want to play with you, but you’re having a hard time coming up with something to do. It is full of quick ideas for simple fun. And every activity is something you can do right now—no research, no prep, and no trips to the store.</p>

<p>So get it now on the App Store <a href="http://www.cakewalkapp.com/get">here</a>. See below for the tech notes on how it was built.</p>

<h1>Tech Notes</h1>

<p>I made a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> server as well as the iPhone client.</p>

<p>The real work in the project has been Marijane and Krista writing the content and taking beautiful pictures, so the first order of business was allow that to be stored in a useful way. Rails is awesome at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> applications, so I made an admin panel of sorts where they could enter the content and attach photos. I tried to practice what I <a href="/blog/2014/02/11/rails-4-engines/">preach</a> and made an admin <a href="/blog/2014/02/11/rails-4-engines/">engine</a> using Bootstrap to make it not terrible to look at.</p>

<p>Then, I made an api engine to serve json for the app to use. The main functionality of the app is listing ideas with various filters which was still fairly straightforward from the data they entered.</p>

<p>Then came the hard part (for me at least). I had not developed an iPhone app since right after Apple first released the SDK and much has changed. This was a great opportunity to see what has been going on. It turns out that a lot has been going on.</p>

<ul>
<li>People make and share libraries now and <a href="http://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a> is a good thing.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking">AFNetworking</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Inferis/ViewDeck">ViewDeck</a> saved me a ton of time.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/cdProgrammingGuide.html">Core Data</a> worked pretty well for my use case.</li>
<li>You can take up the whole screen, but it can get pretty weird.</li>
<li>I couldn't resist doing the <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2042808/inside-the-technology-behind-ios-7s-parallax-effect.html">parallax</a> stuff.</li>
<li>I still didn't use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/interface-builder/">Interface Builder</a> and preferred laying it out with code.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/objectivec/rn-transitioningtoarc/introduction/introduction.html">ARC</a> compiler sure simplified the situation a lot.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/bxGettingStarted.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007502-CH7-SW1">Blocks</a> syntax really cleans things up.</li>
<li>The 2x images for retina display are somewhat annoying but the tooling is much better.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIGestureRecognizer_Class/Reference/Reference.html">Gesture Recognizers</a> may have been there before but I didn't know about them. That's <em>much</em> easier.</li>
</ul>


<p>The whole app is basically a <a href="http://www.appcoda.com/uipageviewcontroller-tutorial-intro/">UIPageViewController</a> to infinitely swipe through idea after idea. On each page is a background image with a parallax effect. The content for the idea is in a <a href="http://idevzilla.com/2010/09/16/uiscrollview-a-really-simple-tutorial/">UIScrollView</a>. I spent way too much time on the interaction between the two components. The background changes and tilts as you scroll up. It's so fun to do the little UI touches.</p>

<p>On the side of the ideas, you can filter what you want to see. This uses <a href="https://github.com/Inferis/ViewDeck">ViewDeck</a> to slide open a controller that has a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITableView_Class/Reference/Reference.html">UITableView</a> of options. Selecting any given option toggles the filters, which affects the list of ideas.</p>

<p>Everything is fairly straightforward. The most interesting parts of this project for me were around performance. For example, my first inclination was to use the APIs to load the list of ideas. Then fetch the idea data when the user swiped to the next one. Where I ended up was completely the opposite. The user rarely interacts directly with the server at all. All of the filtering and loading of the next idea happen locally on the phone immediately using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/cdProgrammingGuide.html">Core Data</a>. The communication with the server happens in a background thread and any different results are injected into the list. This produces a <em>much</em> more fluid user experience.</p>

<p>The other performance issue was figuring out how to run this project at a <em>very</em> low cost even if a million parents decided this was the next big thing. I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> as one of the main solutions. By structuring the API requests well, I've been able to have Cloudflare fully cache the results for a reasonable amount of time. This prevents most requests from even having to hit my server. I did the same thing with web pages like the homepage. If you go to that page, it will stop at Cloudflare. This is very powerful because they can handle a huge amount of users without a problem.</p>

<p>So try out the <a href="http://www.cakewalkapp.com/get">app</a>. It's free and has made me a better parent. If there's anything you want to hear more about, let me know.</p>
