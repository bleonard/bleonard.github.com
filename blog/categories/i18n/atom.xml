    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we launched <a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com">TaskRabbit</a> in London, one of our goals was to have a fully localized product. There are enough differences between British English and US English to not cut (m)any corners. Of course, it's even more important in completely different languages.</p>

<p>An issue that I noticed one day was in our signup flow. It said "Last name is required." This was caused by a blank field and a model-level validation.</p>

<p><code>ruby
class User
  validates :last_name, presence: true
end
</code></p>

<p>It was working as expected, but it should have said "Surname is required." That's what they want across the pond.</p>

<p>We translate all of our "en" locale into "en-GB" but this wasn't there because it more or less works automatically. <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Validations.html">Active Model</a> does a <code>humanize</code> call on the field name. To translate this field, which we had done on stranger field names, you add it to a YML locale file.</p>

<p>```yaml
en:
  activerecord:</p>

<pre><code>attributes:
  user:
    last_name: 'Last Name'
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This is for the one model, but there is <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/ebaf4e40cdcb80ebe16014a2c979f688213d7b92/activemodel/lib/active_model/translation.rb#L61">fallback code</a> in Active Model that also allows you to define the name for all models. You can do this:</p>

<p>```yaml
en:
  attributes:</p>

<pre><code>last_name: 'Last Name'
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This has the advantage of also working for another model as well as an Active Model <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/keeping-your-rails-controllers-dry-with-services">service objects</a> in one shot.</p>

<h2>Generate a File</h2>

<p>So I wrote some code to make sure all fields were defined in our "en" locale. This would ensure that they would get translated into "en-GB" and others. The values are just what Active Model would have done anyway, so there's no functional difference. It does. however, prevent us from missing anything because of Rails magic.</p>

<p>Now we have a rake job that calls <code>Translation::Fields.new.generate!</code> to:</p>

<ul>
<li>load all the models that have attributes/validations</li>
<li>clear out the file and reload I18n</li>
<li>go through all the models and look at each one's attributes</li>
<li>if not already defined, add the humanized version to the file</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is the code. It's been working well so far.</p>

<p>```ruby
module Translation
  class Fields</p>

<pre><code>def initialize
  load_all_models
end

def generate!
  clear_file
  I18n.backend.send(:init_translations) # make sure init'd

  old_locale = I18n.locale
  I18n.locale = "en"
  load_children(ActiveRecord::Base)

  hash = build_hash
  write_file(hash)

  puts ""
  hash
ensure
  I18n.locale = old_locale if old_locale
end

def file_name
  @file_name ||= Rails.root.join("config",
                                 "locales", 
                                 "generated_default_fields.en.yml"
                                ).to_s
end

def clear_file
  write_file({})
end

def write_file(to_file)
  File.open(file_name, 'w') do |file|
    file.write({'en' =&gt; {'attributes' =&gt; to_file}}.ya2yaml)
  end
end

def load_all_models
  # models
  Dir[Rails.root.join('/app/models/**/*.rb')].each do |path|
    require_dependency path
  end

  # can load more objects that have validations here
end

def load_children(klass)
  klass.subclasses.each do |klass|
    attributes = klass.attribute_names

    attributes.each do |attribute|
      current = I18n.t("attributes.#{attribute}", default: "")
      next if current.present?
      all_keys[attribute.to_s] = attribute
    end
  end
end

def build_hash
  out = {}
  all_keys.each do |key, value|
    out[key] = key.humanize
  end
  out
end

def all_keys
  @all_keys ||= {}
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
